The java files in this repo can be downloaded and run or run through CodeSpaces. CarRunner is the only executable, the test file HybridTest contains tests for the Hybrid class.
The directory and JUnit jar files got screwed up when I migrated from codespaces to this repository, so that would need to be fixed to run the tests properly
